SuperTome
=========

A Tome compilation PDF that is intended to eventually be complete enough
such that you can play an entire game without the player needing to rely
on external documents for character creation, gameplay, and character
advancement. It seeems inevitable that the MC may need to rely on
external resources, particularly when trying to find good monsters to
place as opposition. Still, a limited selection of monsters is probably
going to be eventually included in the project, probably as a separate
PDF.
