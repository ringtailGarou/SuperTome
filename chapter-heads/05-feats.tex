\todo{talk about what feats do}

Characters get a feat at 1st level, and another at every level divisible by 3. Creatures also get feats based on their hit dice. Some feats have prerequisites that you must meet before you can use them, though most do not. If a feat has prerequisites and you somehow lose those prerequisites then you cannot use the feat until you regain them.

Some effects, usually class features, give you Bonus Feats. If a specific feat is granted, that effects counts as satisfying the prerequisites (if any). If you're allowed to pick a feat (either from a specific list, or any feat of a particular type, etc), then you must meet the prerequisites for the feat on your own.
