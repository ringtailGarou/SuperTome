\featentry{Ability Focus}
%%%

\textbf{Prerequisite:} Special attack that allows a save (Breath Weapon, Stunning Attack, etc).

\textbf{Benefit:} Add +2 to the save DC of your selected special attack.

\textbf{Special:} You can take this feat more than once. The effects don't stack. Instead, select a new special attack each time.

%%%
\featentry{Hover}
%%%

\textbf{Prerequisite:} Fly speed.

\textbf{Benefit:} When flying, the creature can halt its forward motion and hover in place as a move action. It can then fly in any direction, including straight down or straight up, at half speed, regardless of its maneuverability.

If a creature begins its turn hovering, it can hover in place for the turn and take a full-round action. A hovering creature cannot make wing attacks, but it can attack with all other limbs and appendages it could use in a full attack. The creature can instead use a breath weapon or cast a spell instead of making physical attacks, if it could normally do so.

If a creature of Large size or larger hovers within 20 feet of the ground in an area with lots of loose debris, the draft from its wings creates a hemispherical cloud with a radius of 60 feet. The winds so generated can snuff torches, small campfires, exposed lanterns, and other small, open flames of non-magical origin. Clear vision within the cloud is limited to 10 feet. Creatures have concealment at 15 to 20 feet (20\% miss chance). At 25 feet or more, creatures have total concealment 
(50\% miss chance, and opponents cannot use sight to locate the creature).

Those caught in the cloud must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 10 + 1/2 creature's HD) to cast a spell.

\featentry{Improved Initiative}{[General] [Fighter]}
%%%

\textbf{Benefit:} You get a +4 bonus on initiative checks.

%%%
\featentry{Natural Spell}
%%%

\textbf{Prerequisites:} Wis 13, wild shape ability.

\textbf{Benefit:} You can complete the verbal and somatic components of spells while in a wild shape. You substitute various noises and gestures for the normal verbal and somatic components of a spell.

You can also use any material components or focuses you possess, even if such items are melded within your current form. This feat does not permit the use of magic items while you are in a form that could not ordinarily use them, and you do not gain the ability to speak while in a wild shape.

%%%
\featentry{Rapid Shot}{[General] [Fighter]}
%%%

\textbf{Prerequisites:} Dex 13, \linkfeat{Point Blank Shot}.

\textbf{Benefit:} You can get one extra attack per round with a ranged weapon. The attack is at your highest base attack bonus, but each attack you make in that round (the extra one and the normal ones) takes a -2 penalty. You must use the full attack action to use this feat.

%%%
\featentry{Spell Focus}
%%%

\textbf{Benefit:} Choose a school of magic. Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws against spells from the school of magic you select.

\textbf{Special:} You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new school of magic.

%%%
\featentry{Stand Still}
%%%

You can prevent foes from fleeing or closing.

\textbf{Prerequisite:} Str 13.

\textbf{Benefit:} When a foe's movement out of a square you threaten grants you an attack of opportunity, you can give up that attack and instead attempt to stop your foe in his tracks. Make your attack of opportunity normally. If you hit your foe, he must succeed on a Reflex save against a DC of 10 + your damage roll (the opponent does not actually take damage), or immediately halt as if he had used up his move actions for the round.

Since you use the Stand Still feat in place of your attack of opportunity, you can do so only a number of times per round equal to the number of times per round you could make an attack of opportunity (normally just one).

\textbf{Normal:} Attacks of opportunity cannot halt your foes in their tracks.
