\section{Leadership Feats}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Not all games allow Leadership feats, because all the additional Followers and the Cohort can be a lot to keep track of. If a Character has more than one Leadership feat they still only gain a single set of Followers, and they can still only have a single Cohort. However, they can mix their Follower and Cohort selection from among any allowed to them by their feats (and/or class features).

You lead tiny men.

\textbf{Benefits:} You have a Command Rating equal to your Base Attack Bonus divided by five (round up).

\textbf{+1:} You can muster a group of followers. Your leadership score is your Base Attack Bonus plus your Charisma Modifier.

\textbf{+6:} You are able to delegate command to a loyal cohort. A cohort is an intelligent and loyal creature with a CR at least 2 less than your character level. Cohorts gain levels when you do.

\textbf{+11:} With a Swift Action you may rally troops, allowing all allies within medium range of yourself to reroll their saves vs. Fear and gain a +2 Morale Bonus to attack and damage rolls for 1 minute. This is a language-dependent ability that may be used an unlimited number of times.

\textbf{+16:} Your allies gain a +2 morale bonus to all saving throws if they can see you and you are within medium range.
