You are at your best when fighting with an ally that you are sitting on. This is a Skill Feat that scales with your ranks in Ride.

\textbf{Benefits:} Once per turn, you may attempt to negate an attack that hits your mount by making a Ride skill check with a DC equal to the AC that the attack hit. Attacks that do not require an attack roll cannot be negated in this way.

\textbf{4:} While Mounted, you may take a charge attack at any point along your mount's movement, so long as your mount is moving in a straight line up to the point of your attack.

\textbf{9:} You suffer no penalty to your ride or handle animal skill checks when training or riding unusual mounts such as magical beasts or dragons.

\textbf{14:} You may use your Ride Check in place of your mount's Balance, Jump, Climb, or Reflex Saving Throws.

\textbf{19:} Any time a spell effect would target your mount, you may elect to have it target you instead. Any time a spell effect would target you, you may elect to have it affect your Mount instead.
