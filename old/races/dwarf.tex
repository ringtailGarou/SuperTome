\begin{itemize*}
\item +2 Constitution, -2 Charisma.
\item Medium size.
\item Dwarf base land speed is 20 feet. However, dwarves do not have their movement speed reduced even if the armor check penalty of their armor or load exceeds their BAB. They suffer the other possible effects of excessive armor and load normally (reduced running rate, inability to run, and staggering).
\item Darkvision 60ft
\item Stonecunning: This ability grants a dwarf a +2 racial bonus on \linkskill{Search} checks to notice unusual stonework, such as sliding walls, stonework traps, new construction (even when built to match the old), unsafe stone surfaces, shaky stone ceilings, and the like. Something that isn't stone but that is disguised as stone also counts as unusual stonework. A dwarf who merely comes within 10 feet of unusual stonework can make a Search check as if he were actively searching, and a dwarf can use the Search skill to find stonework traps as a rogue can. A dwarf can also intuit depth, sensing his approximate depth underground as naturally as a human can sense which way is up.
\item Weapon Familiarity: Dwarves may treat dwarven waraxes and dwarven urgroshes as martial weapons, rather than exotic weapons.
\item Stability: A dwarf gains a +4 bonus on ability checks made to resist being bull rushed or tripped when standing on the ground (but not when climbing, flying, riding, or otherwise not standing firmly on the ground).
\item +2 racial bonus on saving throws against poison.
\item +2 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like effects.
\item +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against orcs and goblinoids.
\item +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against monsters of the giant type.
\item +2 racial bonus on \linkskill{Appraise} checks that are related to stone or metal items.
\item +2 racial bonus on \linkskill{Craft} checks that are related to stone or metal.
\item Automatic Languages: Common and Dwarven.
\item Bonus Languages: Giant, Gnome, Goblin, Orc, Terran, and Undercommon.
\item Favored Class: Fighter and Knight
